                    First things first - we&rsquo;re already married. We were wed in 2021 with (almost) no witnesses.

                    February 8, 2025 will be our fourth wedding anniversary. We figured it was time to finally have a gathering in honor of our marriage, have an excuse to bring family and friends together, and we&rsquo;re excited to invite you to a reception.
